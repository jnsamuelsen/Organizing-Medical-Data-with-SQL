# Organizing Medical Data with SQL
A small project regarding relational databases and SQL querying.
The project is centered around data containing medical and demographic information of liver cirrhosis patients. Cirrhosis results from prolonged liver damage, leading to extensive scarring, often due to conditions like hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption. The data provided is sourced from a Mayo Clinic study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver carried out from 1974 to 1984. The data contains different variables including patient demographics, histological changes, and chemical/molecular measurements.

# Database Structure
The RDBMS PostgreSQL was used to implement and query the data into a database.
The database of the liver cirrhosis comprises 3 different tables. A Patient information table, a Histology table, and a chemical composition table.
For developers that want to follow along the project, we here show the structure and relations of the database (that can be set up in any relational DBMS).
