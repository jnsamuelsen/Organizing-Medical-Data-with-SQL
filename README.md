# Organizing Medical Data with SQL
A small project regarding relational databases and SQL querying.
The data contains medical and demographic information of liver cirrhosis patients. Cirrhosis results from prolonged liver damage, leading to extensive scarring, often due to conditions like hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption. The data provided is sourced from a Mayo Clinic study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver carried out from 1974 to 1984.
